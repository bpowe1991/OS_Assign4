This project runs using the command ./oss. There is a default 30 second alarm that can
be user defined with a -t option. The log file for oss operations is by default log.txt,
but can be user defined with -l option.

Due to random nature of process generation, some runs will note very few scheduling 
operations while others will list a many. The 30 sec default timer ususally gives the 
program time to execute multiple operations.

In order to allow enough processes to be generated by oss, the scheduling time for a new
process is set by a random number of nanoseconds instead of full seconds and nanoseconds.

Crt-C interrupt behavior is handled.
